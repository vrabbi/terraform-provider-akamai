<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `match_rules` (Block List) Defines a set of rules for policy (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--match_rules))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `json` (String) A match_rules JSON structure generated from the schema

<a id="nestedblock--match_rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `match_rules`

Required:

- `pass_through_percent` (Number) The range 0.0: 99.0 specifies the percentage of requests that pass through to the origin. The value of 100 means the request always passes through to the origin. A value of -1 means send everyone to the waiting room.

Optional:

- `disabled` (Boolean) If set to true, disables a rule so it is not evaluated against incoming requests.
- `end` (Number) The end time for this match (in seconds since the epoch)
- `match_url` (String) If using a URL match, this property is the URL that the Cloudlet uses to match the incoming request
- `matches` (Block List) Defines a set of match objects (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--match_rules--matches))
- `name` (String) The name of the rule
- `start` (Number) The start time for this match (in seconds since the epoch)

Read-Only:

- `type` (String) The type of Cloudlet the rule is for

<a id="nestedblock--match_rules--matches"></a>
### Nested Schema for `match_rules.matches`

Optional:

- `case_sensitive` (Boolean) If true, the match is case sensitive
- `check_ips` (String) For clientip, continent, countrycode, proxy, and regioncode match types, the part of the request that determines the IP address to use
- `match_operator` (String) Valid entries for this property: contains, exists, and equals
- `match_type` (String) The type of match used
- `match_value` (String) Depends on the matchType
- `negate` (Boolean) If true, negates the match
- `object_match_value` (Block Set) An object used when a rule either includes more complex match criteria, like multiple value attributes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--match_rules--matches--object_match_value))

<a id="nestedblock--match_rules--matches--object_match_value"></a>
### Nested Schema for `match_rules.matches.object_match_value`

Required:

- `type` (String) The array type, which can be one of the following: object or simple. Use the simple option when adding only an array of string-based values

Optional:

- `name` (String) If using a match type that supports name attributes, enter the value in the incoming request to match on. The following match types support this property: cookie, header, parameter, and query
- `name_case_sensitive` (Boolean) Set to true if the entry for the name property should be evaluated based on case sensitivity
- `name_has_wildcard` (Boolean) Set to true if the entry for the name property includes wildcards
- `options` (Block Set, Max: 1) If using the object type, use this set to list the values to match on (use only with the object type) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--match_rules--matches--object_match_value--options))
- `value` (List of String) The value attributes in the incoming request to match on (use only with simple type)

<a id="nestedblock--match_rules--matches--object_match_value--options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `match_rules.matches.object_match_value.options`

Optional:

- `value` (List of String) The value attributes in the incoming request to match on
- `value_case_sensitive` (Boolean) Set to true if the entries for the value property should be evaluated based on case sensitivity
- `value_escaped` (Boolean) Set to true if provided value should be compared in escaped form
- `value_has_wildcard` (Boolean) Set to true if the entries for the value property include wildcards

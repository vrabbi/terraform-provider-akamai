# akamai_cloudlets_edge_redirector_match_rule (Data Source)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `match_rules` (Block List) A set of rules for policy (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--match_rules))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `json` (String) A match_rules JSON structure generated from the schema

<a id="nestedblock--match_rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `match_rules`

Required:

- `redirect_url` (String) The URL Edge Redirector redirects the request to. If using use_relative_url, you can enter a path for the value
- `status_code` (Number) The HTTP response status code (allowed values: 301, 302, 303, 307, 308)

Optional:

- `disabled` (Boolean) If set to true, disables a rule so it is not evaluated against incoming requests.
- `end` (Number) The end time for this match (in seconds since the epoch)
- `match_url` (String) If using a URL match, this property is the URL that the Cloudlet uses to match the incoming request
- `matches` (Block List) Defines a set of match objects (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--match_rules--matches))
- `matches_always` (Boolean) Is used in some cloudlets to support default rules (rule that is always matched)
- `name` (String) The name of the rule
- `start` (Number) The start time for this match (in seconds since the epoch)
- `use_incoming_query_string` (Boolean) If set to true, the Cloudlet includes the query string from the request in the rewritten or forwarded URL
- `use_relative_url` (String) If set to relative_url, takes the path entered for the redirectUrl and sets it in the responseâ€™s Location header. If set to copy_scheme_hostname, creates an absolute path by taking the protocol and hostname from the incoming request and combining them with path information entered for the redirectUrl. If this property is not included, or is set to none, then the redirect_url should be fully-qualified URL

Read-Only:

- `type` (String) The type of Cloudlet the rule is for

<a id="nestedblock--match_rules--matches"></a>
### Nested Schema for `match_rules.matches`

Optional:

- `case_sensitive` (Boolean) If true, the match is case sensitive
- `check_ips` (String) For clientip, continent, countrycode, proxy, and regioncode match types, the part of the request that determines the IP address to use
- `match_operator` (String) Valid entries for this property: contains, exists, and equals
- `match_type` (String) The type of match used
- `match_value` (String) Depends on the matchType
- `negate` (Boolean) If true, negates the match
- `object_match_value` (Block Set) An object used when a rule either includes more complex match criteria, like multiple value attributes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--match_rules--matches--object_match_value))

<a id="nestedblock--match_rules--matches--object_match_value"></a>
### Nested Schema for `match_rules.matches.object_match_value`

Required:

- `type` (String) The array type, which can be one of the following: object or simple. Use the simple option when adding only an array of string-based values

Optional:

- `name` (String) If using a match type that supports name attributes, enter the value in the incoming request to match on. The following match types support this property: cookie, header, parameter, and query
- `name_case_sensitive` (Boolean) Set to true if the entry for the name property should be evaluated based on case sensitivity
- `name_has_wildcard` (Boolean) Set to true if the entry for the name property includes wildcards
- `options` (Block Set, Max: 1) If using the object type, use this set to list the values to match on (use only with the object type) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--match_rules--matches--object_match_value--options))
- `value` (List of String) The value attributes in the incoming request to match on (use only with simple type)

<a id="nestedblock--match_rules--matches--object_match_value--options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `match_rules.matches.object_match_value.options`

Optional:

- `value` (List of String) The value attributes in the incoming request to match on
- `value_case_sensitive` (Boolean) Set to true if the entries for the value property should be evaluated based on case sensitivity
- `value_escaped` (Boolean) Set to true if provided value should be compared in escaped form
- `value_has_wildcard` (Boolean) Set to true if the entries for the value property include wildcards

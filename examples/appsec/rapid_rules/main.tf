# This example presents a sample workflow for rapid rules.
# The `akamai_appsec_rapid_rules` resource enables and configures rapid rules.
# The `akamai_appsec_rapid_rules` data source returns information about rapid rules, including a name, action, action lock, attack group,
# exceptions, and the default action for new rapid rules and rapid ruleset status.
#
# To run this example:
#
# 1. Specify the path to your `.edgerc` file and the section header for the set of credentials to use.
#
# The defaults here expect the `.edgerc` at your home directory and use the credentials under the heading of `default`.
#
# 2. Make changes to the attribute values and in the `rule_definitions.json` file according to your needs.
#
# 3. Open a Terminal or shell instance and initialize the provider with `terraform init`. Then, run `terraform plan` to preview the changes and `terraform apply` to apply your changes.
#
# A successful operation enables and configures rapid rules and returns information about rapid rules, including a name, action, action lock, attack group,
# exceptions, and the default action and rapid ruleset status.

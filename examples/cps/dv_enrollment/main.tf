# This example presents a sample workflow for a DV enrollment. It creates a basic DV enrollment and validates
# that certificate, so it can be deployed to `STAGING` and `PRODUCTION` networks.
#
# To run this example:
#
# 1. Specify the path to your `.edgerc` file and the section header for the set of credentials to use.
#
# The defaults here expect the `.edgerc` at your home directory and use the credentials under the heading of `default`.
#
# 2. Make changes to the attribute values according to your needs.
#
# 3. Open a Terminal or shell instance and initialize the provider with `terraform init`. Then, run `terraform plan` to preview the changes and `terraform apply` to apply your changes.
#
# A successful operation creates a DV enrollment.
#
# 4. Complete the DNS or HTTP challenges for the domain.
#
# 5. Uncomment the `akamai_cps_dv_validation` resource. Then, run `terraform plan` to preview the changes and `terraform apply` to apply your changes.
#
# A successful operation deploys DV certificate to the `STAGING` and `PRODUCTION` networks.

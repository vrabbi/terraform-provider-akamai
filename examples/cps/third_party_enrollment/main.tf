# This example presents a sample workflow for a third-party enrollment. It creates a basic third-party enrollment,
# fetches the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for this enrollment, and then uploads the signed certificate with the `akamai_cps_upload_certificate` resource.
#
# To run this example:
#
# 1. Specify the path to your `.edgerc` file and the section header for the set of credentials to use.
#
# The defaults here expect the `.edgerc` at your home directory and use the credentials under the heading of `default`.
#
# 2. Make changes to the attribute values according to your needs.
#
# 3. Open a Terminal or shell instance and initialize the provider with `terraform init`. Then, run `terraform plan` to preview the changes and `terraform apply` to apply your changes.
#
# A successful operation creates a third-party enrollment and fetches its CSR (Certificate Signing Request).
#
# 4. Use the RSA or ECDSA CSR from the `akamai_cps_csr` data source to retrieve the signed certificate with a third-party tool.
# Uncomment the `akamai_cps_upload_certificate` resource and use the signed certificate in the `certificate_ecdsa_pem` or `certificate_rsa_pem` attribute.
# Optionally, you can provide the trust chains.
#
# 5. Run `terraform apply`.
#
# A successful operation deploys the certificate to the `STAGING` network. To push the changes to
# the `PRODUCTION` network, change the `acknowledge_change_management` attribute to `true`.
